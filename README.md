The big data serving engine - Store, search, rank and organize big data at user serving time.
Vespa is an engine for low-latency computation over large data sets.
It stores and indexes your data and executes distributed queries including evaluation of
machine-learned models over many data points in real time.

## Background

Use cases such as search, recommendation and personalization need to select a subset of data in a large corpus,
evaluate machine-learned models over the selected data, organize and aggregate it and return it, typically in less
than 100 milliseconds, all while the data corpus is continuously changing. 

This is hard to do, especially with large corpuses that needs to be distributed over multiple nodes and evaluated in 
parallel. Vespa is a platform which performs these operations for you. It has been in development for many years 
and is used on a number of large internet services and apps which serve hundreds of thousands of queries from 
Vespa per second.

## Install


To get started using Vespa pick one of the quick start documents:

- [Run on a Mac or Linux machine using Docker](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start.html)
- [Run on a Windows machine using Docker](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start-windows.html)
- [Run on a Mac or Linux machine using VirtualBox+Vagrant](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start-centos.html)
- [Multinode install on AWS EC2](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start-multinode-aws.html)
- [Multinode install on AWS ECS](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start-multinode-aws-ecs.html)

## Usage 

- The application created in the quickstart is fully functional and production ready, but you may want to [add more nodes](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/multinode-systems.html) for redundancy.
- Try the [Blog search and recommendation tutorial](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/tutorials/blog-search.html) to learn more about using Vespa
- See [developing applications](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/jdisc/developing-applications.html) on adding your own Java components to your Vespa application.
- [Vespa APIs](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/api.html) is useful to understand how to interface with Vespa
- Explore the [sample applications](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master)

## Building

You do not need to build Vespa to use it, but if you want to contribute you need to be able to build the code.
This section explains how to build and test Vespa. To understand where to make changes, see [Code-map.md](Code-map.md).
Some suggested improvements with pointers to code are in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

### Development environment

C++ and Java building is supported on CentOS 7.
The Java source can also be built on any platform having Java 11 and Maven installed.
Use the following guide to setup a complete development environment using Docker
for building Vespa, running unit tests and running system tests:
[Vespa development on CentOS 7](https://github.com/vespa-engine/docker-image-dev#vespa-development-on-centos-7).

### Build Java modules

    export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms128m -Xmx1024m"
    ./bootstrap.sh java
    mvn install --threads 1C

Use this if you only need to build the Java modules, otherwise follow the complete development guide above.

### Build RPM packages

See [Building Vespa RPM](docker/README.md#building-vespa-rpm) for details.
